# irradiance_optimization

- Use Irradiance Equalization Principle to sort solar cells to optimize irradiance of individual cells in a switched-array. Recreate results of https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317197
- Use Python logging to make testable and deployable code

TODO:
- Rewrite as a program with actual structure: put functions in separate file and build main to call them.
