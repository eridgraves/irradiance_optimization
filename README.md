# Irradiance equalization (IEq) based reconfiguration for optimization of dynamic photovoltaic arrays (DPVAs)

- Use IEq to optimize irradiance distribution in a DPVA using the methods proposed by "Improved Optimization Strategy for Irradiance Equalization in Dynamic Photovoltaic Arrays". (Avaliable: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6317197 )
- Recreate results of the paper in Python.
- Use Python logging to make testable and deployable code.

TODO:
- Rewrite as a program with actual structure: put functions in separate file and build main to call them.
